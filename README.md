# Super-resolution using CycleGAN-based network

The repository contains Tensorflow implementation of a Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network-based super-resolution neural network (SRNN).

## Purpose of usage/implementation

Internal structures of concrete specimens can be assessed by reconstructing their 3D volumes from the micro-CT images. However, if the evaluated specimen is large, micro-CT device will yield blurry, degraded images. In order to provide a possibility to analyse large specimens, SRNN was applied. Its aim is to increase quality and recover lost details in micro-CT images.

## Overview of attempted approaches to solving the problem

The given micro-CT image dataset was unpaired, i.e. there is no direct correspondence between low-resolution (LR) image and its high-resolution (HR) counterpart. After paper study, I decided to implement and improve either cycle-consistenty image translation, reference-based or artificial dataset generation-based SRNNs. At the moment I saw more potential for imroving specifically cycle-consistenty image translation SRNN. Therefore, I used vanilla CycleGAN to modify it a number of ways:
1) Changed generators (Enhanced deep super-resolution network (EDSR), Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network)
2) Changed discriminators from Markovian to Relativistic average
3) Added multi-modality super-resolution loss function apart from adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss and identity loss
4) Minor changes like hyperparameter tuning/random sampling/added inference framework/etc.

The presented build of the network uses EDSR as generators and Markovian discriminators.
