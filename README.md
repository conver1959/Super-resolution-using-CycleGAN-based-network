# Super-resolution using CycleGAN-based network

The repository contains Tensorflow implementation of a Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network-based super-resolution neural network. 

## Purpose of usage/implementation

Internal structures of concrete specimens can be assessed by reconstructing their 3D volumes from the micro-CT images. However, if the evaluated specimen is large, micro-CT device will yield blurry, degraded images. In order to provide a possibility to analyse large specimens, super-resolution neural network was applied. It was implemented to increase the resolution and recover lost details in images.
